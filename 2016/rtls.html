    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Keeping tabs on all your medical devices</a>.</p>

<p>
  Real time location system (RTLS) in health care is a technology that helps track and identify medical devices, assets, and patients. It can be applied to medical devices, lab equipment, medical specimens, clinicians, patients and maybe one day everything in between. RTLS uses identifiable tags that utilize a combination of rfid , wifi technology, location beacons to track medical assets. It might not sound like much but this is just the brink of the internet of medical things. (if IoT couldn’t sound more gimmicky)  Being able to manage and track various devices lays the foundation for connected healthcare. With RTLS your devices, patients, and assets can be tracked and analyzed in real time at a floor, room or bed level. The best part is that there are quantifiable benefits to implement RTLS in your healthcare operation. The future of IoT relies on technologies like RTLS that actually improve a business’s bottom line.
</p>
<!-- <p>This document outlines options to create a safe alternate route for trail traffic while the Olentangy Trail
is closed under the 315/270 interchange.</p>

<p>The routes proposed will not only serve to keep bike traffic flowing safely during this
construction but will create new connections between neighborhoods and the Olentangy Trail, providing
valuable service well beyond the scope of the 315/270 project.</p> -->

<h2 id="route-options">How Does RTLS Work</h2>

<p>RTLS is relatively simple technology, identifiable tags are placed on a medical device and reference points use the information from the tag to distinguish id and location. These tags can either work by wifi, passive rfid, or active rfid. These tags contain basic information such as device type, id, or patient id. Based on the level of accuracy you want, there are reference points at the bed all the way up to the floor level. For passive rifids a RF transmitter is the reference point that energizes the rfid tags and collects information on the device.   So for example, you can have a transmitter at an individual bed that activates a rfid tag on the surrounding medical devices. This will indicate at this bed these are the devices around it.  Wi-Fi solutions use triangulation to pinpoint where the asset is based on mapped Wi-Fi access points. There is new technology that utilizes zigbee mesh networks which have the advantage of reducing the demand on the local Wi-Fi.   Active tags can also transmit environmental information such as temperature. This is important when you want to see if a sample is maintained at a desired temperature.
</p>
<h2 id="route-options">The Benefits of RTLS</h2>

<p>In an effort to reduce cost and improve the quality of care, hospitals have started to implement RTLS to track and manage their assets. Imagine having the ability to know where all of your medical devices are and see if they are being optimally utilized. This type of technology is widely used in manufacturing settings where time and efficiency is crucial.
</p>

<p>As devices in hospitals continue to grow there needs to be an efficient and accurate way to manage all of these assets. By being able to locate devices faster and maximize their utilization, you can reduce the total number of devices you need to have. This will ultimately reduce capital cost as well as device maintenance costs. Additionally, it can increase the efficacy of preventative maintenance by seeing what devices are being used more frequently and where they are located.
</p>

<p>RTLS not only helps to keep track of assets they can also track clinicians and patients. This enables powerful analytics to be applied. With these added data points you can then analyze your workflows and find inefficiencies. You will be able to analyze at a higher level what is causing non value added time (NVA). When you reduce NVA you improve patient satisfaction and quality of care.
</p>

<p>Security is also an important issue that RTLS can help solve, you don’t want your patient running off with your ventilator or more likely a digital thermometer. RTLS can help alert when your expensive capital is about to leave the building.
</p>
<!-- <p><strong>161 / Olentangy River Road Option</strong> <span class="muted">(marked in blue)</span>: While this route has benefits,
and should be kept under consideration for long-term improvements, it has significant safety challenges.
Improvements required for this route may be beyond the scope of the project.</p> -->

<h2 id="drawbacks">More Devices More Problems</h2>

<!-- <h4 id="add-new-bike-and-pedestrian-park-entrance">Add new bike and pedestrian park entrance</h4> -->

<p>Who is going to actually charge and maintain all these devices? As the devices grow in numbers the more people you will need just to manage the system. It might be manageable to take care of 200 devices but more than that you will probably need to hire additional staff. For some operations it can actually be cost ineffective to implement RTLS Additionally some of the benefits cannot be captured on your balance sheet. </p>
<p> Additionally who is going to want to recharge all these devices? As the number of devices grows we need to start thinking of different energy charging sources or it becomes infeasible to maintain.
These devices can potentially be charged by energy harvesting technology (solar thermal, mechanical) or wireless charging technology.
</p>

  <li>Eliminates conflict between bike and car traffic at the park entrance.</li>
  <li>Removes the hill.</li>
</ul> -->
<h2 id="psycology">The Psychology of RTLS</h2>
<p>
We tend to behave better when we think we are being watched. One interesting anecdote is that RTLS can be used to play a psychological trick by using nonfunctioning tags. You can think of it as the placebo effect for organization.  When people see the tags they assume it is being tracked and put the device in the correct location to prevent themselves from getting in trouble. This might work for a while but staff will catch on pretty fast and you do not get the benefits of real time tracking or analytics.
</p>

<h4 id="future">The Future of RTLS</h4>

<p>
  IoT in the medical field is not some pipe dream, it is making an impact for patients and hospitals today. RTLS has shown that the combination of connected devices and analytics can help gain new insights and efficiencies.
  Just imagine if these devices are now able to move and act on their own autonomously just like Amazon’s Kiva robots. Medical devices can react based on its surroundings and input from the system such as when there is a patient with a heart attack the nearest crash cart/defibrillator autonomously rushes to the scene. Another technology that I look forward combining with RTLS is augmented reality. RTLS can essentially provide you raw historical data of your healthcare operations. Now imagine that you can use that data to build an augmented reality data visualization application. This will allow you to see the system as a whole or at a granular level so that you can find and fix inefficiencies or gain new insights on your operation.  In order to get to that future we need to start small and RTLS is a great first step.

<p>Add treatments to help bikes merge into the travel lane and make the left turn into the park
<span class="muted smaller">(‘A’ on map)</span>. Suggested treatments are sharrows showing the
left-turn movement and a sign along the eastbound lane indicating cars should yield to left-turning
bikes. See image below.</p>

<p>Because of the high volume of traffic on Wilson Bridge, merging into the lane to turn left may be
challenging, even with the above treatments. A left-turn refuge box should be added to give
bikes a safe spot to wait if they are unable to make the turn.</p>

<h4 id="add-bike-boxes-at-hard-road-intersection">Add bike boxes at Hard Road intersection</h4>

<p><a href="http://urbanmilwaukee.com/2014/10/24/bike-czar-tosa-installs-first-bike-box-in-metro-area/">Bike boxes</a>
allow bikes to move up to the front of stopped traffic during the red light cycle and get a head start
into the intersection when the light turns green. <span class="muted smaller">(‘C’ on map)</span>
This reduces right hooks and other conflicts that occur when bikes and cars are mixed going into an
intersection.</p>

<p>There is also an ongoing problem with cars passing and cutting off bikes to turn right on Hard Road from
Linworth Road. Adding a 50ft section of green paint in the Linworth bike lane approaching the intersection
may help highlight the presence of bikes. See image below.</p>

<p>Since bike boxes are fairly new in Columbus, an education campaign is recommended to teach cyclists and
drivers <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/185112">how to use the bike boxes</a>.</p>

bikes. See image below. Another possibility is to add a 4-way stop at the intersection.</p>

<div class="full rounded shadow"><img src="/images/olentangy-trail/sharrow-left-turn-linworth.jpg" /></div>

<h2 id="neighborhood-roads">Neighborhood Roads</h2>

<p>For the remainder of the route into Worthington Hills (Sefton Park Dr, Rutherglen Dr, Southview Dr,
Clubview Blvd) add sharrows and signs indicating shared use road. Speed bumps may also be added
in the future since there is a high volume of cut-through traffic along this route.</p>

<h2 id="olentangy-river-road--161-option">Olentangy River Road / 161 Option</h2>

<p>The second route option requires treatments along Olentangy River Road and State Route 161. Although
this route is not recommended for the current project, it should be kept under consideration for a
future project. For completeness the findings are documented below.</p>

<h2 id="olentangy-river-road">Olentangy River Road</h2>

<p>There is a multi-use trail along the south half of Olentangy River Road. The trail ends just
south of Snouffer Road The northern section of Olentangy River Road is narrow with no shoulder and
limited sight lines. <span class="muted smaller">(‘H’ on map)</span> Widening Olentangy River Road
would require a major reconstruction. Extending the multi-use trail is equally challenging.</p>

<p>Adding sharrows to this section would probably not achieve a sufficient level of safety.
There are limited places to pass along this section of road. Even if the speed limit
were reduced from 45 mph to 35 mph, there would still be a significant speed difference
between cars and bikes, creating pressure for cars to pass bikes where it’s not safe.</p>
<!--  -->
<!-- <h2 id="state-route-161">State Route 161</h2>

<h4 id="southbound-exit-ramp">315 southbound exit ramp</h4>

<p>There is near continuous movement of cars turning right on red from the right-only lane. Drivers are
looking left for other cars and are not expecting bikes, especially contraflow bike traffic from the
right. As a result, even with the walk light, it’s unsafe to cross this exit ramp while cars are present
in the right-only lane. See photo below. <span class="muted smaller"> (‘E’ on map)</span></p>

<div class="full rounded shadow"><img src="/images/olentangy-trail/315-southbound-exit.jpg" /></div>

<p>Adding “No right on red” would help significantly, but seems heavy-handed given current levels of bike
traffic. Another possibility is to install a lighted “Caution bikes / No turn on red” sign that’s
activated by the pedestrian crossing button. This sign could be supplemented with crossing treatment
to raise awareness of the bike crossing. See image below for one possibility.</p>

<div class="full rounded shadow"><img src="/images/olentangy-trail/315-southbound-exit-treatment.jpg" /></div>

<h4 id="northbound-entrance-ramp">315 northbound entrance ramp</h4>

<p>This entrance ramp has numerous problems. There are conflicts between bikes crossing the entrance
ramp and cars turning onto the entrance ramp from both the right and the left. Drivers are focused on
movement of other cars and often do not see bikes, especially contraflow bike traffic from the west.
In addition the exit of the bike underpass is located partway down the entrance ramp with poor
visibility and no safety zone to wait for a safe opportunity to cross. See photo below. <span class="muted smaller">(‘F’ on map)</span></p>

<div class="full rounded shadow"><img src="/images/olentangy-trail/315-northbound-entrance.jpg" /></div>

<p>The recommended solution is to add a bike-only signal phase with diagonal crossing. The signal phase
would be activated by cyclists, either with a button or in-ground detectors. During the bike-only
signal phase, bikes would have a green signal. All other directions would have a red signal, allowing
bikes to cross diagonally. See image below. A lighted “Caution bikes / No turn on red” sign would also
be needed for the 315 southbound exit ramp. This sign would be lit during the bike-only signal phase.</p>

along the line of travel. Sections of the sidewalk should be replaced to fix the seams.</p>

<p>Ideally a concrete safety wall should be added similar to the wall on the Olentangy Trail at
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.051834,-83.030313,3a,75y,266.81h,82.94t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sqKjCx_ut2DXOukymzJCERg!2e0!5m1!1e3?hl=en">Henderson Road</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wayfinding-signage">Wayfinding Signage</h2>

<p>Add wayfinding signage along route. Follow Columbus’s current bike route sign standards. Refer to signs
between Henderson Road side path and Olentangy trail for an example.</p>

<div class="full rounded shadow"><img src="/images/olentangy-trail/bike-route-wayfinding-sign.jpg" /></div>

<h2 id="bike-lane-maintenance">Bike lane maintenance</h2>

<p>Bike tires are susceptible to punctures from road debris that builds up in bike lanes. As debris builds up,
cyclists will start to avoid the bike lanes and ride in the travel lanes.</p>

<p>Bi-weekly sweeping is recommended to keep the bike lanes free of debris.</p>
