<p>
  We are going to make a real-time vitals dashboard to display a patient's SpO2 and blood pressure data. We will use React.js to create modular reactive components that will seamlessly update our dashboard with data we subscribe to using PubNub ( a real-time publish and subscribe system). When vitals data is generated PubNub almost instantly publishes those messages to all the subscribers. With react we can mix and match modular components to create  custom dashboards with the vitals we want to display.
You can find the code here on <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/rajvansia/react-fhir-vitals-es6" target="_blank">github</a>  and the standalone application <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.rajvansia.com/react-pubnub.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I love coding with React.js because building modular components is very intuitive and time efficient. We can create an individual component that can be reused in our dashboard or even any other project.  Let's break down our dashboard in individual components.
</p>
<h1>Displaying Patient Info from FHIR  using React.js</h1>
<p>
The PatientInfo.js component will display basic information of the patient so we can easily identify them. The patient info will update when we select a different patient. This includes the patients full name, age, and medical record number (MRN). This data will be retrieved using the smart and FHIR api using the patient's ID. The patient object gives us access to the age and name property. We then set react property for these variables using setState which is passed to our react components in order to define our data using this.state.age this.state.name. Now to make this component dynamic we will update the view each time we choose a different patient ID.  To make it simple we will create two buttons representing two different patients. onClick for A.A we will pass the patient's ID into the patient define function. Once this function is called it will update the properties of the age and name variables. React uses a virtual DOM which allows fast updates by only updating the components in the DOM that have changed. So only the age mrn and name elements will need to be updated with the new data
</p>
<p>
  The amazing part of react is now that we created this component we can use it anywhere in our react app. If you want to change the data that is being displayed all you need to do is change the properties that are passed through this component.
</p>
<h1>Real-time Blood pressure and SPO2 Component</h1>
<p>
  The next component we will make will display the current SPO2 reading and update its value when we get a new vitals message. The value will change color if it is under the minimum threshold.   Our component will use this.props.spo to display the dynamic SPO2 data of the current state. The SPO2 value changes color using react's inline styling. Instead of your typical if statement we will need to use a ternary operator. So if the SPO2 value is greater than 95 then it will be green else it will be red.  Next we will use PubNub to get real-time SPO2 values and have them displayed in our component.
</p>

<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="2-6"></code>
<h1>
  Using PubNub to Publish and subscribe to  Patient Vitals
</h1>

<p>
  For this example I have created a generator that will publish random vitals data for SPO2 and blood pressure.  Using D3's random function generates a random value based of the mean and standard deviation. We will now  publish this data to PubNub. The basics of a PubNub message is the message payload and the channel that the message will be published to.  From here PubNub will publish this data to all of its subscribers listening on the FHIR channel we created.
</p>
<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="8-12,14-24,132-152"></code>
<p>

</p>
<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="26-32"></code>
<p>
Next we will create the title of our graph displaying the patient's name that is selected. The FHIR read function can be applied to the patient profile object to retrieve their name. This profile resource has access to the patients name emergency contacts and other basic information. In this example we are retrieving the patients given first name and their family name. We will combine their first name and their family name to create their full name which we will store in the formatted varible.  We will call this function later in our c3.js code in the title section of our graph. It will make a lot more sense once you look at how the data is structured for the name attribute.
</p>
<h1 id="route-options"> Retriving The Patient's Blood Pressure Data</h1>

<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="43-71"></code>

<p>

The first part of the code is to use pt.api.search this is a smart function that allows you to search a resources type, furthermore you can query a particular resource by a filter such as the code value to only retrieve relevant information. In this case 55284-4  are the lonic code values for a blood pressure observations which will include systolic and diastolic measurements. Now that our query of all the blood pressure readings for this patient is saved in the bps variable we will loop over each entry and retrieve each encounter where blood pressure was taken. Bp.resource.component will store the individual resource observation in the variable blood. We will then store the date the blood pressure observation was taken on in our x array. This will be the array will store all our dates of the observations and help build our x axis.  Within each bp observation there is a systolic and diastolic entry. We will store the diastolic and systolic values within their own arrays so we can create two line graphs. For a single bp observation we will loop over the components and if it has a 8480-6 lonic code we will store the b.valueQuantity.value in our systolic array. The same goes for our diastolic lonic code 8462-4.

</p>

<p>
So finding a way to actually retrieve data from the resource took longer than I would like I assumed you can just call the patient and access the data by a regular javascript . Object. However as you see on the first line you need to specify the loic codes for the data that you want to access. This does make sense because you want to only access the patients data that is necessary for your application. This prevents you from retrieving patient health data that is not relevant which is a hippa guideline. You only want to have access to just enough patient data to get your job done.

</p>
<h1 id="route-options">Graphing Our Data Using C3.js </h1>
<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="75-91"></code>
<p>
We will create the chart by using a c3.js function .generate. This will create a graph and encapsulate all of its components.  As we said before our title will display the current patient's name. We will call the name() function and the return the patient's name and then concatenate it with "Blood Pressure Data". So you can see when you click on the different buttons the name on the title changes.  Then we declare our x and y variables. In this case  we will have 2 y variables that will generate two line graphs one for systolic pressure and one for diastolic pressure. We will call our diastolic and systolic arrays that we created when we queried our blood pressure observations. The x variable will be the dates when each of the observations were taken. C3.js makes it easy to create a brushing which is a miniaturized version of the graph that you can interact with and select a specific range of x values you want to display on your main graph All you need to do in C3.js to enable this is call subchart true.

</p>
<h1>Formatting our Axis</h1>
<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="92-114"></code>
<p>
Let's now customize our x and y axis. Our x axis will be when we took our blood pressure measurement. To make our chart less busy we will set the amount of tick marks to just 6. Additionally, we change the format of the date to just display month date and year. If we don’t format the date the label will also include the time which makes the graph hard to read. The y axis label our blood pressure readings in mmHg . The y axis will dynamically change based on the y domain for the data set.
</p>


<h1>Creating A Tool Tip</h1>
<code data-gist-id="4ba1fc18b8880e0f0e3bdb2b86da6059" data-gist-line="42,122-135"></code>
<p>
  The tool tip will allow you to click on a data point display the time the blood pressure was taken and both the systolic and diastolic measurement. The title of our tooltip will be the date the measurement was taken. We create a function in line 42 to convert our time into a simple format so it can fit in our tool tip. Lastly we return the Y value of our data point which will be the systolic and diastolic measurement. Try it yourself and click on a point and see what is displayed.
</p>

<p>
  This was a basic introduction on how to use the FHIR api to graph a patient's data using C3.js. This is really the first iteration of the graph and there is room for a lot of improvement. I wish I had a better ability to create test patients and create test data so I can create applications that can combine various data resources. Such as seeing how blood pressure changes when a certain drug is being taken by a patient.  I can make this an ongoing project with added improvements. Here are some of my thoughts.

</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to be able to create better UI for mobile</li>
<li>Enable real time graphing</li>
<li>Calculate and graph mean BP </li>
<li>Show contextual data such as drug usage so I can see the effects on BP
</li>

</ol>
